subtitle: 'Dynamic website builder'
description: 'Elements was a project I created in 2020, originally it was a project that used Vue and Contentful to create a portfolio website for a client. I wanted to be able to dynamically create websites within a CMS, similar to how WordPress worked. This project is mostly abandoned, but I learned a great deal about working with CMS systems. I never finished the migration to Astro, but you can find a development version here: https://pages-mauve-two.vercel.app/'
technologies: ['Astro', 'Tailwind', 'Storyblock']
