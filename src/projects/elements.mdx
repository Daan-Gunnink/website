description: 'Pages was a project I created in 2020, originally it was a project that used Vue and Contentful to create a portfolio website for a client. I wanted to be able to dynamically create websites within a CMS, similar to how WordPress worked. This project is mostly abandoned, but I learned a great deal about working with CMS systems. I never finished the migration to Astro, but i have linked a development version!'
